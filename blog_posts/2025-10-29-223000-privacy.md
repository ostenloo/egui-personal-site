I've always wanted privacy. 

Unfortunately, it seems like to build an online presence, you'd need to compromise a little bit on that. 

I've no desire to build an online presence, but I might need one if I were to contribute to open source projects. 

I haven't contributed yet, of course. But I am fleshing out my portfolio in the hopes that companies may think I'm a competent dev.

And yet, I know I could reach a point where it'd become impossible to erase my digital footprint. Which is something that I'd have to reckon with. 

I'm hesitant. I'm conflicted. 

I could speak more about privacy. 

I think the public eye is a double-edged sword. I'd loathe having to promote myself or do marketing on Linkedin. And I likely won't do that. 

But to send a strong signal, you'd need to at least have a little bit of an online presence. 

Of course, I'd want for my work to do all the "talking". 

Maybe I am thinking too far ahead. Hopefully (?) my next project may make my fears more substantiated!
