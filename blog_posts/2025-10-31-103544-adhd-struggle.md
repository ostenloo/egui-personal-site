This morning I struggled with ADHD again. I woke up early, around 7 am. My plan was to go buy some pencils so I could take handwritten notes. 

I then thought, I will just apply to a few jobs as part of a daily routine. 

I then stumbled upon a job that required a cover letter. So I took my existing template and made some tweaks. 

Then I realized that it had an optional take home assessment. 

I briefly looked at the assessment. And it was a huge chore. 

But I thought I'd do it to increase my chances. 

Unfortunately, it ended up devolving into playing Chess and Pokemon, my two biggest time wasters.

Now its 10:44 am and I am writing this blog post. But not before making some tiny tweaks to my blogging system. 

Maybe I'll finally go buy pencils. 

I'll post an update on how my day went after this. 

*update: It is 7pm. I ended up buying Pens around 2pm. I then took a nap and admittedly I did engage in more dopamine high activities afterwards. I didn't end up submitting that job application but I did tinker around with this website a little bit.*

*I am going to try to learn about GPU programming as I'd like to break into that field.*

*I'll make a separate blog post regarding that.*
