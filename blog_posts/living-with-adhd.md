When I woke up this morning, I thought that I'd spend 2 hours adding a blogging feature to my personal website. 

I asked Claude to do it for me. And it worked!

*...for about 80% of it*

The final 20% required me to *actually understand the code*. 

I know, shocking right? 

So I ended up spending 6 more hours trying to debug what went wrong. I cleaned up some Github actions, configured some Vercel project settings, learned about the differences between rustc, rustup and cargo, and much more! 

Now where does ADHD fall into this? 

Well, the ADHD brain usually has issues prioritizing tasks. 

I had planned to spend only 2 hours on this, and I planned to do other things later on in the day. So I was stuck with the dilemma -- allow this task to spillover, but make sure I complete it, or prioritize things that might be more important? 

I decided to just complete this task. And I'm glad I did. 

I think having ADHD makes it harder to juggle the importance of tasks. 

So might as well just complete what you started.
